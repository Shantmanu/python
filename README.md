Compared with traditional industries, the IT industry has a faster development and update speed. Once it stops learning, it will soon be eliminated by the industry. However, we must be clear: only those who are at the junior level and those who are skilled in technology are eliminated. It is always scarce. Therefore, we still have to be steadfast in learning.


The same is true for self-study of Python. Donâ€™t keep collecting various information websites, buying various books, and downloading a large number of instructional videos. After a few days, the enthusiasm for learning begins to fade, and a few more weeks , And finally completed the learning course-"From entry to giving up". Therefore, learning Python requires one step at a time, and learn it down-to-earth.



# FQ

Before I talk about how to get started with Python, I personally recommend that everyone have their own FQ tools, use Google to search more, look at the world outside the wall, and look at the open source projects on Github.

As for how to FQ, here are the tools I have used: [FQ Tool Set](/Res/FQ.md)



# Python learning resource set

I believe many people will look for various learning materials when learning a certain programming language. To be honest, there are too many materials, but they are useless. According to one's study habits and personal ability, just choose a resource and stick to it.

Because everyone's needs are different, here is a collection of good learning materials for Python:

* [Python Blog Site Resources](/Res/Python Blog Site Resources.md)

There are also some interesting websites:

* [A website where you can see the execution process](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)



# Python Getting Started

For getting started, it is mainly to master the basic grammar and familiar with the programming specifications, so most of the tutorials are basically the same, so it is recommended to choose a tutorial that suits you and stick to it.

In Getting Started with Python, I wrote a series of articles on "Grassroots Learning Python", which is a series of tutorials on Python introduction based on Python 3.6. For better reading, I organize it in [GitBook](https://www.readwithu .com/), I hope to help you get started with Python.

>Note: On February 27, 2018, the introductory part of basic knowledge has been completed. Recently, readers reported that some pictures could not be opened (previously the pictures were placed in Qiniu Cloud, using temporary links. Recently Qiniu Cloud turned this off, which caused the pictures to be unable to be opened), and I have some problems with the previous content. Satisfied, it was decided to make another revision starting on July 7, 2019. But here is an explanation, because I used a windows computer when I wrote it, and now I use a mac, so some examples are screenshots of windows and some are screenshots of mac, don't be surprised.

# Django

There are many different web frameworks under Python. Django is the most representative of the heavyweight players. Many successful websites and apps are based on Django.

If you have some information on your own basics, you can try the [Django blog from building to deployment series tutorial] (https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide- to-django-part-1.html) to get started, this tutorial is very detailed, and there are many interesting pictures. However, because of the wall, many people will not be able to access it. Even if they do, they will not read patiently because they are in English. Therefore I plan to translate this tutorial.
