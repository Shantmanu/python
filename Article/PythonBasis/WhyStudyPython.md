### Python is getting more and more popular

At the beginning of the birth of Python, because of its poor functions, low operating power, no support for multi-core, and no concurrency at all, in the era of not so good computing functions, it has not been popular, and many people even donâ€™t even know that there is this. Language.

With the development of the times, the functions of physical hardware continue to improve, and the complexity of software continues to increase, and development efficiency is increasingly valued by enterprises. Therefore, there is a different voice. In the initial stage of software development, performance is not as important as development efficiency. It is not necessary to increase the amount of development several times in order to save less than 1ms, which is not worthwhile. That is to say, development efficiency is more important than machine efficiency, so Python is gradually being favored by more and more developers.

In the 12-14 years, cloud computing heated up, a large number of startups and Internet giants squeezed into the field of cloud computing, and the most famous open source channel of cloud computing OpenStack was developed based on Python.

In the following years, the most concerned artificial intelligence and machine learning development language was also Python.

So far, Python has become the focus of Internet development. As you can see in the "Top 10 Programming Language Trend Chart", Python has jumped to third place and became the most popular language in 2017.

### Python development salary is high

Python developers are among the highest paid developers, especially in data science, machine learning, and web development.

In the first-tier cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the salary of Python development has reached 2w+.

### Python is easy to get started and powerful

If you are a beginner, learning Python is your best choice, because it is easy to learn, powerful, and easy to build web applications. It is very suitable for beginners as a development language for entry.

Python was once included in the college entrance examination and was included in elementary school textbooks.

If you have a certain programming language foundation, learning Python is also a good choice, because Python is likely to be the mainstream direction of future development. Learn one more language and one more self-defense skill. And Python has a powerful library of functions, can develop tools very quickly, and provide escort for your own development work.
